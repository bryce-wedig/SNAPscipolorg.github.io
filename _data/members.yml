  info: An agricultural researcher and a second-year PhD student at Cornell University, Izzi studies way to fight late blight, the same plant disease that killed crops during the Irish Potato Famine. Late blight is still very much an issue today. Izzi is driven by a desire to contribute in some way to sustainable global food security, whether that is as a scientist, through extension work, or through policy work. She resides in Ithaca, NY but loves the desert heat, and loves to travel.
