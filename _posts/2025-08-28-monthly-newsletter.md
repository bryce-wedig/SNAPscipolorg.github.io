*TLDR: We have several working groups organizing Congressional Visit Days, a SciPol Hackathon, an open access SciPol Course, and an initiative asking candidates for elected office to take a stance on science-related issues.*

Moving forward, our monthly newsletter will be sent via a [Google Group Listserv you can join here](https://groups.google.com/u/3/g/snap-coalition). Have questions about SNAP or want to join our Slack? Email [snapscipolorg@gmail.com](mailto:snapscipolorg@gmail.com).

#SNAP-Visits

SNAP’s [Congressional District Visits](https://snapcoalition.org/initiatives/district-visits/) are in full swing! Early-career scientists from at least 25 states are speaking to lawmakers to advocate for federal science funding. Equipped with personalized one-pagers and their own science stories, these constituents are sending a message: The next generation of scientific researchers wants our lawmakers to sustain public science funding!

#SciPol-Hackathon

SNAP is organizing a Science Policy Hackathon event to take place during the Spring semester! Small groups will tackle policy issues related to science and society, STEM professional formation, and bolstering the STEM workforce. Completed policy solutions will be showcased by SNAP. Are you a graduate student at a university with a science policy group? Or don’t have a science policy grad group, but are interested in forming one? Email us for more info!

#SciPolCourse

SNAP is developing a modular science policy curriculum covering topics such as: What is Science Policy?, How Government Works, Science Communication, and more. These resources can be used to educate students at our home institutions and encourage the creation of new university science policy groups. More intensive course development will take place this fall.

#Stance-on-Science

SNAP will be asking science policy-related questions of candidates running in local, state, and national races during the 2026 elections. We’ll share their responses on our website so voters can better understand where candidates stand on science issues. Interested in helping in your state? Fill out this sign-up form, and we will be in touch with more information. Stay tuned for more details as 2026 approaches!

#McClintock-Letters

This initiative is a nationwide science communication project in which hundreds of scientists wrote to their local hometown papers to convey the value of federally funded research to a diverse audience. So far we have had over 200 pieces published across at least 44 states! We are now examining the impact of this initiative.

#AAAS-2026

Members of SNAP will be attending the AAAS conference in February 2026 and will keep you all apprised of the events we will be participating in.
